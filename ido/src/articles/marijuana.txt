Lod resident goes away for three months, stunned to discover home turned
into marijuana nursery

A Lod resident who left his apartment for three months was stunned to
discover that his home was turned into a marijuana nursery in his absence.
 
The man, an ultra-Orthodox individual with no criminal record, quickly filed
a complaint with police over the unexpected discovery. Authorities are
currently attempting to identify the "temporary tenants" who used the
apartment to grow the illicit drug.

The apartment owner recently bought the property on King Solomon Street in
Lod, just east of Tel Aviv, and planned to rent it out. However, after
potential tenants showed little interest, the man left it empty for the time
being.
 
On Wednesday, the man arrived in the apartment and was surprised to discover
that his lock was changed. After a locksmith broke into the home, the changed
lock surprise paled in comparison to what the man found inside – namely,
marijuana seedlings draped in tin foil placed on the floor, with neon lights
place above them in order to facilitate their growth.
 
Police officers working on the case are currently working to identify the
marijuana growers with the help of other residents in the building.
