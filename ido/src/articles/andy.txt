Andy Ram and Yoni Erlich were knocked out in the first round of the Mexican
Open in Acapulco on Monday in their first match together since November.

Ram and Erlich have rarely teamed-up in the past year-and-a-half, but decided
to play together in Acapulco to prepare for next weekend's Davis Cup World
Group first round tie in Chile.

However, the duo was handed a tough first round draw and after exactly one
hour dropped to a 6-2, 6-4 loss and was knocked out by No. 2 seeds, Marcelo
Melo and Bruno Soares.

Dudi Sela and Harel Levy are also in Mexico, with Sela losing 6-1, 7-6 (0)
to Nicolas Almagro in the first round on Tuesday and Levy falling in the
final round of qualifying on Sunday.

Former two-time champion Carlos Moya lost in the first round for the first
time at the Mexican Open, falling 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 to Richard Gasquet.

Moya won at Acapulco in 2002 and 2004 and was runner-up in 2007. But returning
from an injury-riddled 2009, Moya, given a wild-card entry, didn't quite have
nough to finish off Gasquet, whom he'd never lost to previously.

Gasquet led 4-0 in the last set and claimed all four of his break chances in
the last two sets.

"I am obviously disappointed," Moya said. "I had the match on my racket, I
only needed to close it. I am very happy however with my game level for the
irst set and a half. Gasquet was able to take advantage of the few
opportunities he had to turn the match around."
